The incident occurred after a rainstorm and there was some debris laid out across the road. We were travelling in the morning before sunrise at 20 mph and we felt a small branch or object hit the underside of our car. We took it out to drive again at noon time and it warned us that the coolant was low and that car may not start up once shut down. We towed it to tesla service center in Paramus NJ and they informed us of the condition. They informed us that the coolant pipe was punctured and the coolant spread onto the battery. They explained to us that the branch hit an area and caused the coolant to leak inside the battery and there is no plate to protect it at the underside of the car. They also informed us that there could have been a fire accident if we put it on charge after the underside collision. They also informed us that the coolant pipe was plastic. Despite this flaw in their design, they insist that they will not cover it since it was an external issue and have asked us to pay close to $16,000. Please help

The automatic rear trunk closure button gets water inside wetting the electrical wiring. It has caused my trunk to randomly open at times and more importantly, can cause an electrical fire. This has put my safety, as well as any passengers at risk for injury and or death. I have not reproduced the issue because it has not rained, nor have I had the car washed. I have notified Tesla of this approximately a month ago and they continue to cancel & reschedule my appointment. There seems to be no urgency to investigate or fix the issue. The vehicle has not been inspected by anyone to date. There was no warning lamps or messages prior to the issue.

I own MSLR 2022, on the manual it says to open a rear door in the unlikely situation when no power, fold back the edge of the carpet below the rear seats to expose the mechanical release cable. Pull the mechanical release cable toward the center of the vehicle. I have a floor mat that covers the secret hole stated in the instructions as well. It adds an additional step. My concern is that in a circumstance when the car is on fire or submerged in water, the rear passengers may lack the knowledge or calmness to unlock the doors.

Car was charging in the garage on Dec 30, 2020 when at 5:25 AM a message was sent to my phone that the charging had been interrupted but not completed. 12 minutes later at 5:37 AM a message was sent that the Alarm on the vehicle had been activated. 2 minutes later the second Tesla in the garage sent a message that the alarm had been activated. None of these messages were seen at the time since we were asleep in the back of the house, but the car alarm did wake us up. Hearing the alarm woke us and soon after we heard smoke alarms from teh garage and throughout the house. When we walked to the front of the house, we could see flames from the garage to the top of the second story. We immediately exited the house. The attached article and video describes the situation. https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/04/tesla-fire/ Both Tesla cars and half the house was destroyed by the fire. Tesla never came to the house to inspect the car that started the fire. To date it has not been examined and Tesla takes no responsibility for the damage. They advertise that the battery is warranted and that they will cover any damage caused by a faulty battery, but have refused to do anything.

On 10-16-21 Saturday around 7:40 PM, I was going to my brother-in-law's house which is on the left side of the road I was driving. It is a single lane road in a busy residential area. I wanted to park outside of the house by the road. I took a left turn towards the gate, then slight reverse and put in drive to pull to park parallel to the road. My Tesla Model-x went into 'Sudden Unintended Acceleration' mode, went left to right to left in a violent way, picking up speed like a rocket. I applied the breaks repeatedly, but the car did not stop and continued to race on the road for about 0.3 mile where the road takes slight left turn. It went and crashed into a 40 ft tall big pine tree at probably more than 150 mph. It knocked off part of the compound wall of the owner, and passenger front tire blew away and landed in their front yard. I had the seat belt on. No other vehicle involved. I was the only occupant in the vehicle. No fire. I called 911 from my cell phone. I opened the driver side door manually and got out. Police took the report from me and took pictures. The report will be in another 3 days. Ambulance took me to hospital. Broke rt Ulna, Lumbar 2 vertebra, Pneumothorax lt lung with collapse of left lung, s/p chest tube. Also cervical muscle strain/ rupture. Discharge after 3 days. Still lot of back pain. Unable to go to work. Car is total loss. I have Tesla insurance. Reported the accident to Insurance. Adjuster still working on the claim. Requested to 'Preserve the car' for further investigation. 7-14-21: When I stop at a light, the front end of car goes up by about 4 inches. Took to Tesla service center and I was told it is adaptive suspension and it is normal. 8-10-21. When I apply break to stop at a red light, and when I turn on Left turn signal, power shuts off completely, everything blank in the middle of busy traffic, had to reset power. very scary. Happened twice. complained. Tesla remotely updated SD card. Happened again on 10-15-21.

Backing out of garage, the driver began to smell acid and burnt electronics from the back of car. After driving back home from work the driver inspected the car. The back driver side door reeked of burnt electronics and the entire car had an acid smell. After consulting Tesla, the first Tesla maintenance worker noticed the entire inside of the door had melted and all electronics were fried. He claimed he had never seen this before. The second maintenance worker came with parts and determined the window module had overheated and caught fire. The fire melted many components inside the door. A brand new 2021 Tesla Model Y should not spontaneously catch fire. Especially if it is residing inside the garage of a house. After replacing all the components, Tesla deemed the car safe to drive. Yet, a couple days later they requested we bring the car in so that they could replace the computer that controls the left side of the car to do more research and find the 'root' cause of the fire. There were no warnings for the driver, nor was the driver using that window module. We have not driven the car since as we feel unsafe in the vehicle.

Hello, My driver's side door handle broke back in November/December of 2020. As a result, it prevented me from entering the car on the driver's side. I had it repaired in December 2020. Now, my passenger side door handle has broken as well. My concern here is that if there is an accident where the car is on fire, etc., and the passenger(s) inside my car are unconscious, that someone from outside the car would have a difficult time opening the door to pull them out. they wold need to break the glass and pull them out through the window. Although this is an option/workaround, I believe it puts all passengers in the car at risk of sever injury or death if this type of situation is experiences and time of essence it critical. I'm submitting this information b/c I believe that with the multiple door handle failures that this creates a significant risk to the safety of passengers in my Tesla. As a result, I think a more robust longer term solution is needed for the Tesla Model S. Thanks, Trevor

Tesla Model S door handles are futuristic in design yet they have a major propensity to break on all versions earlier than the v3.0 door handles. My 2015 Tesla Model S have v2.0 and my driver side door handle now fails to extend out to let me into a car. I imagine this is a safety concern if I was in an accident and unconscious and a battery fire were to erupt someone outside my vehicle would have no way to open the door to pull me out. Example from 2019 where a person died from this exact scenario: https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/teslas-futuristic-door-handles-blamed-death-fiery-wreck

AFTER THE CAR WAS POSITIONED INTO THE PARKING LOT AND JUST BEFORE STOPPING, IT ACCELERATED ALL OF A SUDDEN, SWERVED LEFT AND HIT A PLANTER IN FRONT AND ANOTHER PLANTER ON THE LEFT BEFORE COMING TO A STOP. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND MY FAMILY TOO AND REPORTED TO THE DEALERSHIP. I DID NOT LEAVE UNTIL TESLA FIRE AND TESLA SECURITY FOLKS CAME IN AND TOOK STOCK OF THE SITUATION. THEY FOUND THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL LOCKED IN POSITION AND HAD TO MANUALLY UNLOCK IT USING TOOLS. 3 OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN THE CAR (INCLUDING KIDS). TESLA HAS NOT OFFERED ANY EXPLANATION FOR THE LAST 6 DAYS AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED.

I WAS BACKING OUT OF MY GARAGE AND THE LEFT REAR END OF MY CAR HIT A CAR PARKED BEHIND ME. MY CAR IMMEDIATELY SPED UP IN FORWARD DIRECTION IN AN ARC CAUSING ME TO HIT JUST INSIDE GARAGE ON THE LEFT . I TRIED TO BRAKE AND TO PUT IT INTO PARK AND NOTHING WAS WORKING. IT FINALLY WENT INTO NEUTRAL AND QUIT HITTING THE GARAGE. THERE WAS LOTS OF SMOKE AND I THOUGHT CAR WAS ON FIRE. THERE WAS LOTS OF BURNED RUBBER UNDER MY LEFT REAR TIRE CAUSING THE SMOKE. NONE UNDER RIGHT SIDE. THERE WERE WORKERS AT THE HOUSE (CAR BEHIND ME) AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE CAR DOING IT. I WASN'T SURE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I CALLED TESLA THAT DAY AND A TOTAL OF 5 TIMES AND WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CONTACTED BY SPECIAL TEAM IN ABOUT 6 WEEKS AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD WHAT HAPPENED FROM COMPUTER. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM TESLA. MY CAR WAS CHECKED OUT AT THE TESLA SHOP IN COUNCIL BLUFFS AFTER BODY WORK DONE AND THEY SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO CHECK COMPUTER AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT WOULD BE DONE BY TESLA ENGINEERS. MY INSURANCE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY INFORMATION EITHER. THEY ASKED ME TO REPORT UNEXPLAINED ACCELERATION ON THIS SITE. IT DID $23,000 IN DAMAGES TO MY CAR AND $25,000 TO MY HOUSE AND KNOCKED IT OFF FOUNDATION IN AFFECTED CORNER. IF BOTH TIRES HAD BEEN SPINNING I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE HERE AS I WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH GARAGE AND FLYING AS IT IS A ONE STORY DROP TO THE BACK. I WANT TO KNOW MY CAR IS SAFE BEFORE DRIVING AGAIN AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT WHY INCIDENT HAPPENED.

MY 2014 TESLA ONLY 11K MILES. WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AROUND 5K, I HAVE TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO TESLA FOR SERVICE THE SUSPENSION SYSTEM WAS AT FAULT THAT CAR COULD NOT BE RAISED AT SOME SPEED BUMP, AS A RESULT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR HIT THE SPEED BUMP. I CONSIDER IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS INSTALLED UNDERNEATH THE CAR WHICH COULD CAUSE FIRE IF THE BATTERY HOT HIT AND RAPTURED.

HERE IS A TESLA MODEL S IN THE JUNKYARD. HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLEDETAILS/35042733?ROWNUMBER=1 IT IS TOTALLY BURNED OUT. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE FIRE STARTED WHEN THE CAR WAS STORED IN THE JUNKYARD.SINCE THERE IS BURNED AND MELTED DEBRIS SURROUNDING THE CAR. ITHE FRONT LH WHEEL AND SUSPENSION ASSEMBLY IS NO LONGER IN ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE. INSTEAD OF BEING BOLTED TO THE CAR THE BROKEN STEERING KNUCKLE IS STASHED IN THE FRONT SEAT. THIS IS MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THE TOW-TRUCK DRIVER PICKED IT UP OFF THE GROUND AT THE SCENE OF THE CRASH AND THREW IT INSIDE THE CAR. I AM WONDERING HOW MUCH LONGER YOU WILL ALLOW THESE DEADLY DEFECTIVE CARS TO ROAM THE HIGHWAYS. NHTSA DATABASE HAS HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS. MANY OWNERS ARE NOW COMING FORWARD AND LODGING COMPLAINTS BUT THERE WOULD BE MANY MORE OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED NOT TO FILE COMPLAINTS. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE: HTTPS://JALOPNIK.COM/ONE-WEEK-OLD-TESLA-MODEL-X-HAS-CATASTROPHIC-SUSPENSION-1844564706 SNIP** ONE WEEK-OLD TESLA MODEL X HAS CATASTROPHIC SUSPENSION FAILURE AND THE RESULTING TWITTER FEED IS AS BAD AS YOU'D THINK** TESLA ZEALOTS PILE IN TO ABUSE THE OWNER AND DISCOURAGE HIM FROM REPORTING. IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS FOLLOWED THAT ADVICE. DO PLEASE TAKE ACTION OTHERWISE I WILL GET VERY CROSS. THANK YOU. KEEF [XXX] THE UNHINGED.

HERE IS A TESLA FRESHLY ARRIVED IN THE JUNKYARD. HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLEDETAILS/36822732?ROWNUMBER=0 ITT IS BURNED OUT BUT JUDGING BY THE ASHES AROUND THE VEHICLE IT HAS MOST LIKELY BURST INTO FLAMES WHILE STORED IN THE JUNKYARD POST CRASH. THE BACK WHEEL HAS GONE WHOMPY WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A TESLA. THERE IS NO CRASH DAMAGE AT THE BACK OF THE CAR THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE WHEEL WENT WHOMPY. IT WENT WHOMPY BEFORE THE CRASH. THE FRONT WHEEL AND SUSPENSION HAS SNAPPED OFF AND HAS ESCAPED THE FIRE BECAUSE IT WAS LYING ON THE GROUND NEXT TO THE CAR DURING THE FIRE. THE AIR-SHOCK IS STASHED INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE IT WAS STASHED THERE BY THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER. THE FRONT WHEEL IS CLEANLY SLICED IN HALF. THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE IN TESLAS. THE SUSPENSION BREAKS WHILST THE CAR IS TRAVELLING AND THE BROKEN PART GOUGES THE WHEEL WHILST IT IS ROTATING. MANY SIMILAR CASES CAN BE SEEN HERE; HTTPS://WWW.FLICKR.COM/PHOTOS/136377865@N05/ALBUMS/72157661343139261 TESLA SUSPENSIONS ARE DEFECTIVE. I BET YOU A SIGNED DOLLAR.

THE MCU AND THE SPEEDOMETER OF MY TESLA ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY BECAUSE THE CAR MANUFACTURER MADE A DESIGN ERROR WITH THE CHIP CARD AND ALSO ON THE WAY OF THE CAR CONTROLS THE HEAT COMING IN TO THE CABIN AND IT LITERALLY MELTS DOWN THE SCREEN AND THE SPEEDOMETER. GLUE COMES OUT EVERY MINUTE CREATING A DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE IT GETS STICKY ON YOUR HANDS AND WHILE YOU TRY TO REMOVE IT THE SCREEN GOES BLACK OR FREEZES. THE MOST COMMON ONE IS THAT THE SCREEN OR MCU FREEZES UP CONSTANTLY AND THEN THE CAR CAN'T BE RUN. HARD RESET WORK SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES WON'T . I CONTACT THEM AND THEY WANTED ME TO PAY $2600 FOR SOMETHING IT IS THEIR DESIGN FLAW . THIS IS A DANGER FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS BY TESLA REPLACING THE MCU AT NOT COST SINCE IT IS A DESIGN PROBLEM . THOSE ISSUES HAPPENS ON BOTH, WHILE PARKED AND DRIVING , SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE DRIVING AND THE SCREEN WON'T WORK AT ALL, YOU TOUCH IT AND NOTHING WORKS . AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE PICTURES BELOW , THE GLUE WILL COME DOWN FORM THE THE SCREENS AND START GOING ALL OVER THE CAR , THAT CREATES A HAZARD FOR DRIVING AND ALSO POSSIBLY FOR A FIRE SINCE THE SCREEN IT IS MELTING.

MCU FAILURE (MARCH 2020) FROM EMMC MEMORY WEAR-OUT RESULTED IN NON-FUNCTIONING CAR. CAR WOULD NOT "TURN OFF," THEREBY ENTIRELY DRAINING BATTERIES. SINCE THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS ON DURING MCU FAILURE, IT WOULD REMAIN ON, NO MATTER WHAT I DID, THEREBY (A) RUNNING DOWN THE BATTERY, AND (B) POTENTIALLY CREATING A MAINTENANCE OR FIRE HAZARD (AC RUNNING FOR 12 HOURS). ALSO NON-FUNCTIONAL WAS CRUISE CONTROL, RADIO, REAR CAMERA, AUDIBLE WARNINGS (LIKE TURN-SIGNAL CLICKS), INABILITY TO CONTROL BATTERY CHARGING, LOSS OF NAVIGATION, PARKING WARNING CHIMES, ENERGY USAGE GRAPH, CELL FEATURES, ETC. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE "CREEP" FEATURE, WHICH MOVES THE CAR FORWARD WHEN PEDAL IS LIFTED, ALSO DID NOT WORK -- CAUSING ME TO HAVE TO RELEARN CERTAIN DRIVE FEATURES, AND AT ONE POINT ALLOWING THE CAR TO ROLL BACKWARD WHEN IT USUALLY WOULD HAVE CREEPED FORWARD. IT'S UNKNOWN IF CERTAIN EMERGENCY BRAKING FEATURES WOULD HAVE WORKED. MAIN VEHICLE CONTROL SYSTEMS FUNCTIONED (STEERING & BRAKES), BUT NOTHING ELSE DID, AND DRIVING WAS VERY CONCERNING. COST TO REPAIR WAS $1575. HOWEVER, THE SAME TYPE OF COMPUTER WAS INSTALLED, WHICH LEADS TO CONCERNS THAT THE SAME PROBLEM MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. SEE ALSO NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: PE20010. *TR

THIS IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT A BURNED OUT TESLA MODEL 3. I HAVE USED THE VIN OF A RANDOM WRECKED TESLA BECAUSE THE VIN OF THE CAR IN QUESTION IS UNRECOGNISABLE DUE TO FIRE. HERE IS THE TOASTED TESLA HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLEDETAILS/35451122/25 IT HAS BEEN BURNED TO A CRISP BUT THE FRONT WHEEL HAS BEEN WRENCHED OFF DUE TO THE USUAL BROKEN SUSPENSION ARMS AND POPPED BALL JOINTS. THE WHEEL MUST HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE IT IS NOT BURNED IN THE SLIGHTEST AND HAS BEEN STASHED INSIDE THE BODY OF THE CAR POST-INFERNO. ISN'T THE JOB OF NHTSA SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS? FOR THE LOVE OF FUDGE PLEASE DO SOMETHING. REGARDS YOUR FRIEND KEEF

MY CAR SUDDENLY LOST APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES OF BATTERY RANGE OVERNIGHT AFTER AN OVER THE AIR UPDATE BY TESLA. THE CAR ALSO BEGAN CHARGING SLOWER AFTER THE UPDATE. I BELIEVE THE UPDATE HAS DECREASED THE BATTERY LIFE OF MY CAR AND CAPPED IT TO PREVENT THE CHANCE OF THE CAR CATCHING ON FIRE SINCE THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO SEVERAL TESLA MODEL S VEHICLES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A FAULTY BATTERY IS STILL IN THE CARS

THE ORIGINAL MILES WERE 265 MILES WHEN THE CAR WAS NEW. OF COURSE NORMAL DEGRADATION IS EXPECTED. I CURRENTLY ONLY GET 239 MILES ON A FULL CHARGE AS APPOSE TO 255 MILES.

IN THE PAST YEAR, MY CAR HAS LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RANGE, AND HAS EXPERIENCED SLOWER CHARGING SPEEDS. AFTER CALLING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF A TESLA SERVICE CENTER, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BATTERY AND THAT THE REPORTS OF A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT LOWERED RANGE WERE RUMORS. I EXPERIENCED A 6% DECREASE IN RANGE IN A FEW MONTHS. MY CAR WAS 6 YEARS OLD AND ONLY AND 9% BATTERY DEGREDATION OVER THAT PERIOD. IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS IT HAS LOST AN ADDITIONAL 6% RANGE NOW TOTALING 15%, AND THAT ADDITIONAL RANGE REDUCTION SEEMS TO BE LINKED TO A SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM TESLA. IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BATTERY THAT MAY CAUSE A FIRE, AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT TESLA DID INDEED ROLL OUT A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO INCREASE SAFETY, TESLA SHOULD REPLACE THE BATTERIES INSTEAD OF REDUCING THE RAGE . THE MOST SAFE THING TO DO IS REPLACE THE BATTERIES. I LOVE MY CAR, AND I AM A BIG FAN OF TESLA. TESLA IS VERY PROUD OF SAFETY IN THEIR CARS, SO THEY SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE THESE BATTERIES.

THIS IS A COMPLAINT RELATED TO THE TESLA BATTERY FIRES INVESTIGATION. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE USED THE VIN OF ANOTHER 2017 TESLA TO BE ABLE TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT. THE WRECK OF THE BURNED OUT TESLA HAS NOW SHOWED UP IN THE SALVAGE YARD BUT IT IS TOO BADLY BURNED TO BE ABLE TO READ THE VIN. THERE WAS A FIRE ON JANUARY 10TH IN ARLINGTON INVOLVING A TESLA MODEL S HERE IS A VIDEO SHOWING THE TESLA ON FIRE OUTSIDE THE GARAGE AND SPEWING FLAMES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=RTXKM_0I8VG THIS BURNED OUT WRECK WHICH IS NOW IN A CHICAGO SALVAGE YARD IS VERY LIKELY TO BE THE CAR THAT WAS ON FIRE. HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/27044150 THE VIDEO OF THAT FIRE SHOWS JUST HOW DANGEROUS A BURNING TESLA IS. EVEN WITH SEVERAL FIRE-ENGINES AND THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WATER IT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTINGUISH. AN OCCUPANT OF THE HOUSE WAS TREATED BY PARAMEDICS. THE TESLA FAN CLUB HAS TRIED TO DEFLECT THE BLAME ON TO "CHRISTMAS LIGHTS" HTTPS://TESLAMOTORSCLUB.COM/TMC/THREADS/CHRISTMAS-LIGHT-HOME-FIRE-IN-ARLINGTON-HEIGHTS-IL.181401/ YEAH RIGHT! IT'S A LITTLE PAST THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS! AS I AM SURE YOU WILL BE AWARE A SINGLE LITHIUM BATTERY CELL HAS ALWAYS GOT A NON-ZERO PERCENTAGE CHANCE OF CATCHING FIRE DUE TO INTERNAL SHORT CIRCUIT. WHEN THERE ARE 7000 CELLS TIGHTLY PACKED TOGETHER A CHAIN REACTION A HIGHLY LIKELY OUTCOME. TESLA IS NOW TINKERING ABOUT WITH THE CHARGING RATES BUT THIS WILL NEVER ELIMINATE THE CHANCES OF THESE FIRES. PLEASE KEEP INVESTIGATING. THANK YOU. KEEF

ON 4/17/2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 2:40PM I PULLED INTO A SMALL SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT AND TURNED RIGHT TO PARK IN A PARKING SPACE FACING A STORE FRONT. I WAS GOING TO A NAIL APPOINTMENT, WAS EARLY AND NOT IN A HURRY. THE CAR WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY UNDER THE CAR'S OWN POWER AS I ENTERED THE PARKING SPACE. WHEN I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO PULL TO THE FRONT OF THE SPACE THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED JUMPING THE CURB, AND LANDING ON TOP OF THE SIDEWALK WITH THE FRONT END INSIDE THE STORE FRONT WINDOW. I WAS BRAKING FROM THE MOMENT OF FAST ACCELERATION AND COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP UNTIL IT WAS STOPPED BY THE STORE FRONT GLASS WALL. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS INJURED, BUT THERE WAS PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE GLASS AND FRAME STORE FRONT AND TO THE FRONT END OF MY CAR. THE CAR WAS FULLY UP ON THE SIDEWALK WITH THE FRONT END INTO THE FRONT OF THE PIZZA SHOP. THE CURB WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES HIGH, SO WHEN THE FIREMAN REVERSED THE CAR TO MOVE IT TO THE PARKING SPACE THE ENTIRE UNDERNEATH SCRAPED ALONG THE BOTTOM, FORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T ANY DAMAGE TO THE BATTERY PACK. THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME TO T HE SCENE, AND A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED DUE TO THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE BUSINESS. THE FIREMAN HAD TO BACK THE CAR OUT DUE TO POTENTIAL INTEGRITY ISSUES WITH THE DAMAGED GLASS STORE FRONT. I WAS NOT CITED. A CLAIM WAS FILED WITH STATE FARM. I CAN OBTAIN THE POLICE REPORT IF NEEDED. THERE WEREN'T ANY OTHER VEHICLES OR PEOPLE INVOLVED.

WE HAD AN ACCIDENT 2DAYS AGO. WE WERE IN THE SCHOOL LOOP TO DROP OFF OUR SON TO SCHOOL. MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AND WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE DROP OFF AREA WHEN EVERYTHING JUST HAPPENED SO FAST, THE NEXT THING I KNEW IS THAT WE HIT ONE OF THE IN-GROUND INSTALLED BASKETBALL HOOPS. THE IMPACT WAS HARD AND DEPLOYED ALL THE AIRBAGS ON THE PASSENGER SEATS AND THE SIDE AIRBAG OF THE DRIVER AND THE 2ND ROW PASSENGER SEATS WHERE MY SON WAS SEATED AND ALSO SAW SOME SMOKE FROM THE FRONT WHERE I WAS SEATED AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE BUT MY HUSBAND INFORMED ME THERE WAS NONE. RECALLING NOW, IT HAS BEEN A MYSTERY TO US AS TO WHY AND WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. I WAS SEATED ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND SUSTAINED A FRACTURE IN THE RIGHT SCAPULA AND GENERALIZED CONTUSIONS IN MY BODY AREA. MY SON WHO WAS SEATED ON THE 2ND ROW ALSO SUSTAINED CONTUSIONS ON HIS FACE AND A FEW LACERATIONS. WE WERE COMING INTO THE SCHOOL LOOP AND WAS RUNNING ON A SOMEWHAT 20MPH SPEED, I WAS WONDERING IF THE VEHICLE DID ACCELERATE IT'S SPEED CAUSE WHY WOULD WE HAVE SUCH A HARD IMPACT AND SUSTAINED THOSE INJURIES:  THAT IT EVEN DEPLOYED ALMOST ALL THE AIRBAGS? HOPE SOMEONE CAN LOOK INTO THIS SO AS NOT TO HAVE ANYONE BE ON OUR SAME FATE AND FOR EVERYONE'S FUTURE SAFETY. THANK YOU.

NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP19005 - INVESTIGATION SUBJECT : BATTERY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES. VIA SOFTWARE UPDATES, TESLA, SUDDENLY, INEXPLICABLY, REDUCED MAXIMUM VOLTAGE OF THE MAIN BATTERY. THE ACTION RESULTED IN INSTANT LOSS OF DISTANCE MILEAGE OF THE CAR OF 12 PERCENT, FROM 237 MILES TO 208 MILES. HORSEPOWER AND GENERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR WAS ALSO REDUCED. TESLA HAS IMPLIED THAT THIS ACTION WAS TAKEN, FOR SELECTED TESLA CARS, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AS A FIRE-SAFETY UPDATE, BUT OFFICIALLY NO SAFETY RECALLS RELATED TO THIS UNEXPLAINED ACTION HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED. NO ONE ASSOCIATED WITH TESLA HAS OFFERED ANY FURTHER DETAILED EXPLANATION FOR THIS SUDDEN ACTION, WHICH, IN ADDITION TO REDUCING PERFORMANCE AND DISTANCE MILEAGE OF THE CAR, HAS ALSO REDUCED, OVERNIGHT, ITS INTRINSIC ASSET VALUE. THE RESULTS DESCRIBED HERE HAPPENED OVERNIGHT, WHILE THE CAR WAS AT REST---PARKED INSIDE A GARAGE.

THIS COMPLAINT MAY REFER TO THE REFERENCE NUMBER PROVIDED BELOW: NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP19005 - INVESTIGATION SUBJECT: BATTERY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES TO WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN, BACK TO MAY 2019, TESLA PUSHED A SOFTWARE UPDATE, FIRMWARE NUMBER 2019.16.2, TO MY CAR VIA OVER-THE-AIR(OTA) METHOD. RIGHT AFTER INSTALLING IT IN MY CAR, I NOTICED THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE CAR'S RANGE. SOFTWARE VERSION 2019.16.2 WAS RELEASED AFTER SEVERAL NON-CRUSH FIRES HAPPENED WORLDWIDE ON THE BATTERY PACK WITH THE SAME SIZE AND SPEC AS MINE (85 KWH). NEW SOFTWARE CAPPED THE MAX VOLTAGE FOR BOTH CHARGING AND DISCHARGING THE BATTERY, TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE FOR THE BATTERY GETTING OVERHEATED BUT IN THE MEANTIME REDUCED THE CAR'S PERFORMANCE AND RANGE THAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR. IN THE MEANTIME, THE HAZARDOUS FOR THE BATTERY CATCHING FIRE HAS NOT BEEN FULLY RESOLVED. TESLA SERVICE TEAM DECLINED MY SERVICE REQUEST AND KEEPS TELLING ME THAT MY BATTERY IS "OPERATING NORMALLY" AND REFUSE TO PROVIDE ANY MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ISSUE WHILE I HAVE TO SUFFER THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THE REDUCED RANGE AND CHARGING SPEED. PLUS I HAVE TO KEEP THE CAR WITH THE BATTERY MAY CATCHING FIRE ANYTIME IDLING ON MY DRIVEWAY OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WHERE I AND MY FAMILY LIVES IN. THE BATTERY LOSING ALMOST 20% OF CAPACITY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS "OPERATING NORMALLY" AND SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED AS "FAILURE PARTS" WHICH NEED IMMEDIATE REPLACE UNDER WARRANTY (8 YEARS, UNLIMITED MILEAGE, MINE IS EXPIRING 12/2020). IF THE RANGE LOSS IS A PRECAUTION METHOD FOR THE FIRE SITUATION, TESLA SHOULD NOTIFY THE AFFECTED OWNERS AND COME UP WITH A PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR THIS ISSUE. WITH TESLA'S ATTITUDE OF REFUSING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE AFFECTED OWNERS OR PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION ON THIS MATTER, I URGE NHTSA TO START AN INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDE US A DEFINITE ANSWER. SINCERELY *TR

DUE TO A FIRMWARE UPGRADE THAT WAS PERFORMED BY THE DEALER WHEN REPLACING MY MCU, MY TOTAL BATTERY RANGE WAS REDUCED FROM 249 MILES TO 213 MILES INITIALLY. THROUGH FURTHER UPDATES THE RANGE INCREASED TO 220 MILES AND THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED ISSUE BY TESLA THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY BATTERY REPLACEMENT WITH A BATTERY THAT HAS AT LEAST THE ACTUAL RANGE I HAD BEFORE THE UPDATE (~250 MILES) OR BETTER. IF THE MODEL S 85 BATTERY IS A FIRE RISK AT THE RANGE CUSTOMERS WERE QUOTED, THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL BECAUSE THROUGH PURCHASE OF A VEHICLE, THE RANGE AND SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE GUARANTEED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND NOT THROUGH A FIRMWARE UPGRADE I DIDN'T EVEN REQUEST. SEE SERVICE RECORD ATTACHED.

THE BATTERY FOR THE 2013 MODEL S 60KWH 2013 IS NOT CHARGING ANYWHERE NEAR THE CAPACITY. CHARGING THE BATTERY TAKES HOURS TO GET TO NEAR 65% OF WHAT USE TO BE FULL CHARGE AND IS NOW CONSIDERED A 100% CHARGE. THIS IS UNDER WARRANTY AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ASAP. THIS HAS SEVERE IMPACT TO DAILY COMMUTE AND ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE CAR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS STARTING WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE IN MAY 2019, TESLA CAPPED THE MAX VOLTAGE THE HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY WOULD CHARGE TO. THEY CLAIM THEY DID THIS "OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION" AFTER SEVERAL NON-CRASH FIRES HAPPENED TO THESE MODELS.

I HAVE A 90D THAT IS NOW SEEM TO BE A 75D. TESLA UPDATE 10 HAS TAKEN AWAY VOLTAGE. THE CAR NOW DRIVES IN THE LOW 300S WHEREAS IT USED TO BE MID 250S. THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY RANGE. BEFORE UPDATE 10, I GOT 277 MILES AT 90%. TWO SUPER CHARGERS AGO, AFTER LOADING UPDATE 10, IT WOULD ONLY CHARGE TO 266 MI AT 100% THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY FAST CHARGING SPEEDS. THE CAR USED TO CHARGE BETWEEN 107 TO 110 KW PER HOUR AND NOW TOPS IS 60S AND 70S. I UNDERSTAND NORMAL BATTERY DEGRADATION BUT THIS IS NOT IT. I CALLED TESLA YESTERDAY 11 /26 /2019, TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE SERVICE REP MENTIONED THAT THE LAST UPDATES MAY HAVE ROLLED OUT FIXES FOR BATTERY LONGEVITY AND HEALTH. MY ISSUES ARE THAT I PAID FOR A 90D AND NOW HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A 75 D. WHY? IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH BATTERY HEALTH, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IT CAUSING A FIRE AS HAS APPEARED IN THE NEWS LATELY, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND WOULD LIKE IT FIXED. I DON'T NEED A FIRE ERUPTED IN MY GARAGE RIGHT BELOW MY BEDROOM WHILE I'M SLEEPING. ALSO I NEED TO TAKE 1500 MILE TRIP SHORTLY AND AM NOW EXTREMELY NERVOUS THAT SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN. ON TOP OF THAT UNCERTAINTY, THERE IS ALSO EXTRA THE HOURS THAT WILL BE ADDED TO MY TRIP DUE TO THIS DECREASE IN MILEAGE, CHARGING SPEED AND PERFORMANCE. AS A LONE FEMALE DRIVER I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ON THE ROAD LONGER THAN I HAVE TO BE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I PAID FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GET THERE SOONER THAN IT WILL NOW. PLEASE HELP TO GET ANSWERS AND TO GET THIS SAFETY ISSUE FIXED.

I WISH TO FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT A TESLA MODEL 3 IN THE INTEREST OF HUMAN SAFETY. THIS IS CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF BATTERY FIRES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT HAS SO FAR GONE UNREPORTED. HERE IS A MODEL 3 IN THE SALVAGE AUCTION YARD THAT HAS BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE. HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLEDETAILS?ITEMID=34394730&ROWNUMBER=2&SIMILARVEHICLEITEMID=&ISNEXT=&LOADRECENT=TRUE THE CAR IS SO BADLY BURNED THAT THE VIN IS NOT ABLE TO BE DETERMINED BUT THE AUCTION SITE WOULD HAVE THAT RECORD. I HAVE SUBSTITUTED THE VIN OF ANOTHER WRECKED MODEL 3 IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS REPORT. THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT POST ON TESLA MOTORS CLUB FORUM WHICH PROVIDES PHOTOS OF THE FIRE SCENE ON THE HIGHWAY AT VACAVILLE AND THE IMAGES MATCH THE JUNKYARD CAR. IT SEEMS THAT TESLA IS USING THE "RAN OVER A TRAILER HITCH ON THE ROADWAY" AKA "CAT ATE MY HOMEWORK" EXCUSE AGAIN BUT LOOKING AT THE PHOTOS IT SEEMS THAT A WHOMPY WHEEL IS THE MORE LIKELY CAUSE. HTTPS://TESLAMOTORSCLUB.COM/TMC/THREADS/ANOTHER-TESLA-FIRE.175198/ **** DDAWSON, TODAY AT 9:51 AM VACAVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAR FIRE. I WAS TOLD THE OWNER RAN OVER A TRAILER HITCH THAT FELL OFF A TRUCK. I BELIEVE ITS A 3. NO ONE HURT AT LEAST.. **** AND *** THIS STORY ACTUALLY DID RUN ON THE 11:00 NEWS, SUNDAY NOV. 24TH, ON KPIX (OUR LOCAL CBS AFFILIATE). IT WAS REPORTED BY BRIAN HACKNEY. THE STORY WASN'T CLEAR ABOUT WHERE THE FIRE TOOK PLACE, OTHER THAN IN VACAVILLE WHERE THERE DOES HAPPEN TO BE A SUPERCHARGER. THEY SHOWED THE SAME DRAMATIC IMAGE OF THE BURNED-OUT CAR. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS INJURED HERE. THE WEIRD PART IS THAT THE KPIX WEBSITE NEVER SHOWED THE STORY. I SEARCHED AFTERWARD, AND THE OTHER STORIES REPORTED THAT NIGHT (INCLUDING THE ONE ABOUT PRIUS CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS) WERE ALL UP, EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE** PLEASE INVESTIGATE. THANK YOU.

ON MAY 15TH, 2019 WITH 103,249 MILES ON MY ODOMETER, I UPGRADED MY TESLA MODEL S 70D FIRMWARE FROM VERSION 2019.12.11 TO 2019.16.1.1. ON MY NEXT CHARGE TO 80%, MY MILEAGE CAPACITY WAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED FROM 199 MILES TO 167 MILES FOR A LOSS OF OVER 30+ MILES FOR NO KNOWN REASON. I DISCUSSED THIS WITH A COWORKER WHO HAS A SIMILAR EARLY 2016 MODEL S 70D WHO EXPERIENCED THE SAME SAME LOSS OF RANGE. MY RESEARCH HAS LEAD ME TO UNDERSTAND TESLA TOOK ACTION TO DOWNGRADE HORSEPOWER AND RANGE ALONG WITH ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE THROUGH A TOTAL VOLTAGE CAP AFTER CLAIMING TO BE RELEASING A FIRE-SAFETY UPDATE, BUT OFFICIALLY NO SAFETY UPDATE WAS RELEASED. THIS CHANGE HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED IN MY GARAGE AND STATIONARY.

THIS IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE TESLA BATTERIES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF AN NHTSA INVESTIGATION. I DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL VIN OF THE CAR IN QUESTION SO I HAVE HAD TO SUBSTITUTE THE VIN FROM ONE OF THE MANY TESLAS IN A JUNKYARD. HERE IS A REPORT FROM A TESLA OWNER IN AUSTRALIA WHO IS GETTING EVEN WORSE SERVICE THAN IS NORMAL FOR TESLA. HTTPS://TESLAMOTORSCLUB.COM/TMC/THREADS/WARRANTY-DOES-ANYONE-HAVE-THEIR-WARRANTY-TERMS-FROM-2017.172151/ *** SNIP*** WARRANTY - DOES ANYONE HAVE THEIR WARRANTY TERMS FROM 2017 DISCUSSION IN 'AUSTRALIA' STARTED BY CSL2C3000, TODAY AT 6:36 PM. LOCATION: MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA CSL2C3000, TODAY AT 6:36 PM HI, I HAVE HAD AN ISSUE WHICH RELATES TO LOW VOLTAGE AND SO I'VE SPOKEN TO TESLA WHO'VE SAID THAT THE CAR NEEDS A NEW BATTERY PACK AND IT IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. THEY LOOKED AT REMOTE LOGS AND CONCLUDED THIS WITHOUT AN INSPECTION. THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT IS $50K INC AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO POTENTIAL FOR A SINGLE BATTERY BANK TO BE AT FAULT (BASED UPON WHAT THEY'VE SAID). THEY'VE QUOTED THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE WARRANTY TO ME BUT MY LEGAL GUYS SAY THAT THE TERMS THAT APPLY ARE THOSE THAT APPLIED WHEN THE CAR WAS SOLD, NOT THE CURRENT TERMS. THEY'VE ASKED ME TO TRY TO TRACK DOWN THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY. THE CAR IS A CP 04/17, BUILT 07/17, TESLA, MODEL X, 75D. I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS A WARRANTY FROM 2017? SPECIFICALLY THE CLAUSE RELATED TO BATTERY PACK WARRANTY. THANKING YOU ****** I BELIEVE THAT YOUR INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER TESLAS THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD OUTSIDE OF USA. THESE BATTERY FAILURES AND POTENTIAL FIRE RISKS APPLY TO ALL TESLAS SOLD ACROSS THE WORLD. THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER. CONCERNED CITIZEN ETC.

RE: NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP19005 - INVESTIGATION SUBJECT : BATTERY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES AFTER MOST RECENT FIRMWARE UPDATE (EXACT DATE UNKNOWN -- SOMETIME LATE THIS SUMMER)-- SUPERCHARGING SPEED APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LIMITED. IT NOW TAKES 2-3X THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO CHARGE WHEN TRAVELING. I TESTED MULTIPLE SUPERCHARGERS FOR MY TRIP WHICH OCCURRED ON DURING THE WEEKEND OF 9/2. I AM FULLY AWARE OF CONDITIONS THAT CAN SLOW THE SPEED (STALL SHARING, HIGH SOC, LOW/HIGH BATTERY TEMP, ETC). NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT -- YET MY CHARGE SPEED WAS LIMITED DURING ALL CHARGING SESSIONS AND ACROSS MULTIPLE LOCATIONS/DATES/TIMES DURING THIS TRIP. I'VE BROUGHT THIS CONCERN UP ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS: 1. 9/5/19 - WAS TOLD "TESTED ON SUPERCHARGER AND VERIFIED VEHICLE CHARGING AT EXPECTED RATE, NO FURTHER ACTION REQUIRED" 2. 10/3/19 - VERBALLY - SPOKE TO MOBILE SERVICE TECHNICIAN WHILE PERFORMING SERVICE AT MY HOUSE. HE DID NOT CONFIRM OR DENY MY CHARGE RATE WAS LIMITED. I AM CONCERNED THAT MY BATTERY CHARGE RATE IS LIMITED DUE TO A FIRE RISK, AS THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS RELEASED AFTER CARS CAUGHT ON FIRE THIS YEAR.

HERE IS A TESLA MODEL X IN THE JUNKYARD. HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/53118179/PHOTOS IT APPEARS TO HAVE BURNED UP IN THE JUNKYARD PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE BATTERY PACK WAS DAMAGED IN A CRASH AND IT DECIDED TO WAIT A WHILE BEFORE SELF COMBUSTING. BOTH BACK WHEELS HAVE SNAPPED OFF DESPITE THERE BEING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THAT PART OF THE CAR. THE BROKEN SUSPENSION ARM FROM ONE OF THE BACK WHEELS HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE PASSENGER SEAT ( SEE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPH) AND IS STILL RECOGNIZABLE DESPITE THE FIRE. THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF CASES OF TESLA SUSPENSION BREAKAGES BOTH FROM OWNERS AND FROM CONCERNED CITIZENS. RATHER THAN INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THESE FAILURES MR. ELON MUSK HAS CALLED THE COMPLAINTS "FRAUDULENT" AND THE COMPLAINANT "UNHINGED" HTTPS://TWITTER.COM/ELONMUSK/STATUS/741411531582115841?LANG=EN "OF GREATER CONCERN: 37 OF 40 SUSPENSION COMPLAINTS TO NHTSA WERE FRAUDULENT, I.E. FALSE LOCATION OR VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS WERE USED. WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ONE OR MORE PEOPLE SOUGHT TO CREATE THE FALSE IMPRESSION OF A SAFETY ISSUE WHERE NONE EXISTED. Q IS WHY?" IT IS NOW MORE THAN 3 YEARS ON. MORE LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. I HAVE NOT BEEN CHARGED WITH MAKING FRAUDULENT COMPLAINTS. THE SUSPENSIONS ARE STILL FAILING. I AM NOT HAPPY.

I HAVE A P85D AND SINCE RECENT SOFTWARE UPDATES MY RANGE HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY.. MY SUPERCHARGER SESSIONS HAVE ALSO BECOME EXTREMELY SLOW RESULTING IN ALMOST AN AN EXTRA HOUR TO CHARGE THE CAR COMPARED TO BEFORE UPDATES. THESE UPDATES SEEM TO BE A MAKESHIFT COVER FOR DEFECTIVE BATTERIES DUE TO HIGH FIRE AND EXPLOSION RISK, WHICH HAVE OCCURRED ON OTHER TESLA CARS. SO INSTEAD OF FIXING BATTERIES TESLA REDUCED THEIR CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE BOARD.

RE: NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP19005 - INVESTIGATION SUBJECT : BATTERY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES I AM AN EARLY MODEL TESLA OWNER. I STOPPED ACCEPTING OTA UPDATES TO MY CAR BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE THE NEW FEATURES BEING ROLLED OUT. I HAVE FOUND A NEW STORY ONLINE ON TESLA THAT THEY RELEASED AN OTA UPDATE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AFTER FIRES IN EARLY TESLA MODELS BUT THEY DO NOT GO INTO ANY SPECIFICS. AFTER READING FORUMS FOR OTHER OWNERS I SEE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH OUR CARS THAT TESLA REFUSES TO COMMUNICATE WITH US. ARE WE SAFE OR NOT WITHOUT THE UPDATE? ALSO OTA UPDATES ARE NOT MANDATORY SO IF THEY DID DO A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR SAFETY THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY OTHERS LIKE MYSELF THAT DO NOT HAVE THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATE AND ARE NO LONGER SAFE. I AM AFRAID THAT MY VEHICLE MIGHT CATCH FIRE BUT TESLA WON'T ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AND NEED YOUR HELP. THANKS

THIS IS IN REGARDS TO NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP19005 - INVESTIGATION SUBJECT : BATTERY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE UPDATES TESLA PUSHED A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO OUR CARS IN APRIL/MAY OF THIS YEAR THAT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES RANGE AND POWER USING A VOLTAGE CAP THAT ALSO REMOVED ABOUT $30,000 WORTH OF PAID UPGRADES TO RANGE AND HORSEPOWER (ELECTRIC CARS NEED VOLTS FOR BOTH RANGE AND POWER, SO TESLA'S REDUCTION TOOK SUBSTANTIAL VALUE OUT OF THE CARS AFFECTED). TESLA CLAIMS THEY DOWNGRADED OUR CARS "OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION" AFTER A SERIES OF CARS CAUGHT FIRE WHILE PARKED (NON-COLLISION, NON-PHYSICALLY DAMAGED VEHICLES, THAT CAUGHT FIRE FOR APPARENTLY FOR NO REASON - SOME AFTER BEING UNUSED FOR SEVERAL DAYS). TESLA INITIALLY CLAIMED THE UPDATE WAS REMOVING FEATURES WE PAID FOR "OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION" BUT NOW TESLA WILL NOT TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUE IS SAFETY RELATED. THIS IS A CRITICAL OMISSION, BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANY NHTSA RECALL NOTICE POSTED, OR SERVICE BULLETIN, OR OTHERWISE SAFETY RELATED OFFICIAL INFORMATION. THOUSANDS OF TESLA OWNERS ARE CHOOSING TO SKIP THE UPDATE, BECAUSE IT CAN INSTANTLY REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CARS BY HALF AND MAKE THEM UNUSABLE IF PEOPLE BOUGHT THE RANGE UPGRADES OUT OF NECESSITY. DISTANCES THAT WERE ABLE TO BE DRIVEN BEFORE THE UPDATE ARE IMPOSSIBLE AFTERWARD. PURCHASES WERE CALCULATED ON THIS AND THE RANGE UPGRADES WERE MADE FOR THE ADDITIONAL RANGE THE SOFTWARE UPDATE REMOVES. PLEASE GO FORWARD WITH THIS INVESTIGATION. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW: 1) IS THERE A SAFETY ISSUE? 2) DOES THE UPDATE ADDRESS A WARRANTY PROBLEM? 3) IS MY HARDWARE FAULTY? WILL IT BE REPAIRED? WHY WAS IT REDUCED? 4) ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T CONNECT THEIR CAR TO WIRELESS INTERNET AT RISK FROM NOT BEING UPDATED?

WHEN I PURCHASED MY CAR LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, IT CAME WITH A 50,000 MILE, 4 YEAR "NEW CAR" WARRANTY ALTHOUGH IT WAS A USED CAR WITH APPROX 25K MILES. WITHIN 6 MONTHS, AN UPDATE CAME OUT OVER THE AIR AND CHANGED MY SOFTWARE, AND ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A RANGE LOSS OF APPROX 40 MILES AND AN INCREASE IN CHARGING TIME BY APPROX 3X BECAUSE TESLA, ADMITTEDLY THROUGH THEIR SERVICE TEXTS, HAS LIMITED THE CHARGING ON MY CAR TO "PRESERVE BATTERY LIFE." THIS IS AKIN TO SELLING ME A 8 CYLINDER CAR, AND LIMITING IT TO 6 TO NOT HAVE TO CHANGE ENGINE. THE CAR HAS BECOME ALMOST UNUSABLE AS IT TAKES 3 HOURS TO CHARGE WHEN IT USED TO TAKE 45 MINUTES. THE CAR WAS ABLE TO GET A FULL 116 KW FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THE BATTERY WAS BELOW 15%-30% AND THE CHARGING WOULD GRADUALLY (OVER 45 MINUTES) DROP TO ABOUT 40KW. NOW IT STARTS AT AROUND 110 KW AND QUICKLY (WITHIN 5 MINUTES) DROPS TO BELOW 80KW. IT TAPERS OFF AND CHARGES AROUND AN AVERAGE OF 35-40 KW. TESLA SHOULD BE CHANGING THE BATTERIES AS THEY KNOWINGLY ARE DOING THIS TO STOP THE BATTERY FROM OVER HEATING AND STARTING ON FIRE. THIS IS A HAZARD AND TESLA, INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE PART WITH A WARRANTY, LIMITS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT TELLING THE OWNER.

ON OR ABOUT JUNE 24, 2019, MY PARKED CAR'S SOFTWARE WAS FORCIBLY UPDATED WITHOUT MY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTIFICATION AND WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. THIS FORCED SOFTWARE UPDATE REDUCED THE NOMINAL CAPACITY OF MY BATTERY BY 16.02%. ON JUNE 23, 2019, MY 100% STATE OF CHARGE (SOC) WOULD CHARGE EACH CELL IN MY BATTERY PACK TO 4.2 VOLTS, RESULTING IN A RATED RANGE OF 256 MILES. UPON ENTERING MY PARKED CAR ON JUNE 24, I DISCOVERED THAT TESLA "CAPPED" THE BATTERY SUCH THAT EACH CELL WOULD ONLY CHARGE TO APPROXIMATELY 4.09 VOLTS, RESULTING IN A RATED RANGE OF 215 MILES AT A 100% SOC, OR A RATED RANGE LOSS OF 41 MILES. THEY ALSO SLOWED THE CHARGING RATE BY OVER 50%. FOUR TESLA CARS THAT WERE PARKED RECENTLY CAUGHT FIRE. AFTER THE FOURTH FIRE, TESLA ISSUED AN OVER THE AIR (OTA) SOFTWARE UPDATE PREVENTING THE FULL CHARGING (E.G., TO 4.2 VOLTS FOR EACH CELL) OF THE BATTERY PACK, LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT THAT CAN BE "PULLED" FROM THE BATTERY PACK AT ANY ONE TIME, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF ACCELERATION. TESLA STATED THE UPDATE WAS "OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION" AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF SEVERAL NON-CRASH FIRES. TESLA UNILATERALLY TOOK THIS ACTION OF ISSUING A "FIRE-SAFETY UPDATE" WITHOUT INFORMING THE CAR OWNERS OF THE REASON FOR THE UPDATE, WHY SAID UPDATE SHOULD BE INSTALLED AND THE EFFECT ON THE CAR ONCE THE UPDATE WAS INSTALLED. IN MY CASE, THE UPDATE WAS FORCED ON MY PARKED CAR VIA AN OTA UPDATE ON JUNE 23 (OR 24) WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO ME NOR REQUESTING MY APPROVAL NOR INFORMING ME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF INSTALLING THE UPDATE (REDUCED RANGE, POWER, ETC.), TESLA SAID THAT THEY WERE RELEASING A FIRE-SAFETY UPDATE, BUT OFFICIALLY NO SAFETY UPDATE WAS RELEASED.

SINCE MAY SOFTWARE UPDATES, I DON'T KNOW THE REAL REASON WHY TESLA LIMIT MY CAR'S BATTERY: MAYBE TO SHUT OFF A SINGLE BATTERY MODULE LIKE THE ONE THAT CAUSED A CAR TO CATCH FIRE IN SHANGHAI (SAME YEAR MODEL AS MY CAR)... OR DECREASE THE BATTERY VOLTAGE TO REDUCE POTENTIAL FIRE...BUT IS IT RIGHT AND LEGAL THAT I PAID FOR A TOP OF THE LINE PERFORMANCE MODEL S P85D AND NOW TESLA LIMITED IT TO ONLY 68-69 KWH? I WOULD NOT MIND IF I PAID FOR 70 KWH AND BE LIMITED BY TESLA TO 68 KWH, BUT MY BATTERY IS 85 KWH AND LIMITED TO ONLY 68KWH! THE POWER ALSO SEEMED TO BE REDUCED AND CHARGING IS TAKING MUCH LONGER. WHAT MADE ME REALLY MAD IS THAT TESLA WENT BEHIND MY BACK AND CHEATED LIKE THAT USING OTA UPDATES.

ON JUNE 27, 2019 I BROUGHT MY CAR TO A TESLA SERVICE CENTER FOR MAINTAINANCE UNRELATED TO THE BATTERY OR DRIVE UNIT. DURING THE VISIT TESLA DOWNLOADED A NEW SOFTWARE REVISION TO MY CAR THAT IMMEDIATELY LIMITED RANGE, POWER, CHARGE RATE AND BATTERY CAPACITY. I NOTICED THIS AND BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO HAVE THE BATTERY CHECKED FOR DAMAGE, NOT KNOWING THAT TESLA HAD PURPOSEFULLY THROTTLED MY BATTERY. TESLA TOLD ME THAT MY CAR WAS LIMITED VIA SOFTWARE BECAUSE OF AGE AND OFFERED NO FURTHER EXPLANATION. I FELT THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE REASON TESLA WOULD LIMIT MY BATTERY. THIS IS WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT SEVERAL TESLA'S IN THE AGE RANGE OF MINE HAD SPONTANEOUSLY CAUGHT FIRE AND MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN LIMITED VIA THE SAME SOFTWARE UPDATE AS MINE. TESLA NEEDS TO REPLACE THESE FAULTY BATTERIES, NOT LIMIT THE USE. THAT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION.

11 DAYS AGO, THE DOORS AND WINDOWS STOPPED WORKING ON MY TESLA MODEL S. THE CAR WAS PARKED, AND WHEN I CLICKED ON THE "OPEN" BUTTON TO CAUSE THE DOOR HANDLES TO EXTEND, I DISCOVERED THAT THE DRIVER-SIDE HANDLE NO LONGER OPENED. IN FACT, 3 OF THE 4 DOORS NO LONGER OPENED. IN ADDITION, AFTER CRAWLING IN THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR, I DISCOVERED THAT THE WINDOWS NO LONGER OPENED EITHER. IN ADDITION TO BEING A NUISANCE, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, IF THE CAR IS IN AN ACCIDENT, EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR. SECOND, IF A DRIVER IS APPROACHED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ANOTHER PERSON, HE/SHE CANNOT OPEN THE WINDOW TO COMMUNICATE. IN FACT, EARLIER THIS YEAR, A DRIVER PERISHED IN A FIERY TESLA CRASH. THE POLICE WERE UNABLE TO RESCUE HIM, BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT OPEN HIS DOOR. SEE HTTPS://WWW.AUTOBLOG.COM/2019/02/25/FATAL-TESLA-MODEL-S-CRASH-FIRE/. "ACCORDING TO REPORTS, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND ONLOOKERS SAY THEY WERE UNABLE TO RESCUE THE DRIVER. THE AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYING DOOR HANDLES ON THE OUTSIDE DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE DEPLOYED." APPARENTLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF TESLA CARS WITH THIS PROBLEM. SEE HTTPS://FORUMS.TESLA.COM/FORUM/FORUMS/DOOR-HANDLE-NOT-FUNCTIONING FOR A SNAPSHOT. FOR AN EXAMPLE, SEE HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=L4J3BEB5NOG. I CONTACTED AT LEAST 7 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT TESLA, BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO VIEW THIS AS A SAFETY HAZARD. THEY WERE MORE FOCUSED ON CHARGING ME FOR WHAT THEY CALL AN "OUT-OF-WARRANTY" EVENT, EVEN THOUGH THIS PROBLEM WITH DEFECTIVE WINDOWS AND DOORS HAS PERSISTED SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. IN FACT, I HAVE DOCUMENTED A LONG LIST OF SERVICE FAILURES WITH THIS TESLA MODEL S. I HAVE OVER 100 EMAILS OUTLINING THESE PROBLEMS, RANGING FROM DEFECTIVE DOORS/WINDOWS TO A BATTERY MALFUNCTION TO MORE. I CAN SHARE THESE UPON REQUEST.

BEGINNING IN JUNE, THE SUBJECT VEHICLE SUFFERED FROM A SEVERE AND SUDDEN DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF RANGE AVAILABLE AS A DIRECT RESULT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES ISSUED BY TESLA WITHOUT DISCLOSURE TO OWNERS. PRIOR TO THE UPDATES, THE SUBJECT VEHICLE HAD APPROXIMATELY 255 RATED MILES AVAILABLE. FOLLOWING UPDATES 2019.16.1 AND 2019.16.2, THE SUBJECT VEHICLE SUFFERED IMMEDIATELY FROM A RANGE DROP TO 225 AVAILABLE MILES. THE SUBJECT VEHICLE HAS ALSO BEEN UNABLE TO CHARGE FULLY AND NOW SUFFERS FROM DECREASED CHARGING SPEEDS. THE OWNER OF THE SUBJECT VEHICLE WENT TO NCDS ARBITRATION, SEEKING A MANUFACTURER REPLACEMENT OF THE BATTERY UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THE ARBITRATOR DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NO PROOF OF DEFECT. TESLA CLAIMS THAT THIS IS NORMAL DEGRADATION. HOWEVER, THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE CAUSED SOLELY BY TESLA'S SOFTWARE UPDATES, FOR WHICH IT HAS YET TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THERE ARE CARS AFFECTED AND POTENTIALLY AT HIGHER RISK OF CATCHING ON FIRE. TESLA HAS FAILED TO COMMUNICATE ANYTHING WITH REGARDS TO THE SAFETY OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES AND HAS CONTINUED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT PROVIDING OWNERS WITH ANY NOTICE OR INFORMATION THAT THEIR VEHICLE MAY BE AFFECTED. THE OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE WAS DENIED A WARRANTY REPLACEMENT AFTER HAVING THE CLAIMS ARBITRATED WITH NATIONAL CENTER FOR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT, WHERE THE ARBITRATOR FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO MANUFACTURING DEFECT. THE SUBJECT VEHICLE CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM A HIGH RATE OF BATTERY LOSS WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND NOT IN OPERATION. THE CAR HAS NOT REGAINED ANY MILEAGE AS A RESULT OF TESLA'S MOST RECENT UPDATES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. THE SUBJECT VEHICLE SUFFERS FORM REDUCED CHARGING SPEEDS AND IS NOT CAPABLE OF REACHING THE SAME NUMBER OF MILES AS IT DID BEFORE.

MY LI-ION BATTERY HAS BEEN DEGRADED RECENTLY BY AN OVER-THE-AIR SOFTWARE UPDATE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS UPDATE IS RELATED TO THE RECENT BATTERY FIRES (4 IN LADT 4 MONTHS, INCLUDING ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO). ONLY A FEW (100 TO A FEW THOUSAND I BELIEVE) OF THE TESLAS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AS MINE HAS BEEN. I AM NOW CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE. WILL MY BATTERY CATCH ON FIRE IN MY GARAGE? I WOULD LIKE NHTSA TO REVIEW THE CHANGES MADE BY TESLA AND APPROVE THAT THESE CHANGES WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE SAFETY OF MY BATTERY. OR, DOES THIS POINT TO A DEFECTIVE BATTERY AND SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR SAFETY REASONS?

THIS IS ANOTHER COMPLAINT ABOUT THE TESLA SUSPENSIONS. COMMENTING IN THIS FORUM:HTTPS://SEEKINGALPHA.COM/NEWS/3396557-MUSK-DENIES-MURDOCH-FAVORITE-TESLA-CHAIR *** SIMON MAC, CONTRIBUTOR COMMENTS2440 | + FOLLOW @IDAHO STOIC MEANWHILE TESLA HAVE REDESIGNED THE SUSPENSION CONTROL ARMS FOR THE MODEL S/X WITH MUCH STRONGER FORGED ITEMS. MY MODEL S HAD REPLACEMENT SUSPENSION LINKS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WHICH IN FAIRNESS TO TESLA WERE DONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A TSB AND WITHOUT ME BRINGING IT UP AS A CONCERN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. I ALSO HAD A LOT OF WORK DONE ON THE HV JUNCTION BOX (AGAIN NOT RAISED BY ME). THIS SEEMED TO HAPPEN NOT FAR AFTER THE SUC FIRE IN NORWAY A LITTLE WHILE BACK, A LOT OF OTHER MODEL S OWNERS I KNOW HAD THE SAME WORK CARRIED OUT. THE QUESTION IS ARE THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE SKIPPING THE SUGGESTED MAINTENANCE REGIME, MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF WORK WHICH IS BORDERLINE RECALL, AND TESLA ARE DOING STUFF THAT CAN'T BE OTA'D UNDER THE COVER OF SERVICING.*** PLEASE READ THIS REPORT FROM AN OWNER AND DEMAND THAT TESLA RECALL ALL AFFECTED CARS TO AVOID FURTHER CRASHES AND LOSS OF LIFE. I AM NOT A TESLA OWNER. I AM A CONCERNED CITIZEN. MY FULL NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS SUBMISSION.

ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE THAT I JUST READ ON YAHOO FINANCE, THE TELEGRAPH HAS REPORTED TODAY THAT BRITISH TV DIRECTOR'S TESLA BURSTS INTO FLAMES SITTING IN TRAFFIC. ACTOR MARY MCCORMACK HAS SHARED VIDEO OF HER BRITISH HUSBAND'S TESLA CAR SHOOTING FLAMES WHILE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC. HE HAD BEEN DRIVING ALONG A MAJOR ROUTE THROUGH LOS ANGELES, WHEN THE FIRE WAS FIRST SPOTTED BY OTHER ROAD USERS.SHE SAID THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT, AND THE INCIDENT WAS OUT OF THE BLUE. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND AND HIS CAR TODAY. NO ACCIDENT, OUT OF THE BLUE, IN TRAFFIC ON SANTA MONICA BLVD. SHE ALSO SAID, THANK YOU TO THE KIND COUPLE WHO FLAGGED HIM DOWN AND TOLD HIM TO PULL OVER. AND THANK GOD MY THREE GIRLS WEREN'T IN THE CAR WITH HIM. SHERIFF'S LT. WILLIAN NASH IN WEST HOLLYWOOD SAID ON SATURDAY THAT DEPUTIES SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND THEN FIRE. DEPUTIES REQUESTED HELP FROM FIREFIGHTERS WHO QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED THE FLAMES.

SAFETY ISSUE WITH REAR DOORS. REAR PASSENGERS AND SPECIALLY CHILDREN WHO ARE UNABLE TO EXIT THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE CAN BECOME TRAPPED IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE OR MAJOR COLLISION THAT DISABLES THE ELECTRICAL POWER TO THE DOORS. FRONT DOORS ARE EQUIPPED WITH EMERGENCY RELEASE LATCH HOWEVER, REAR DOORS HAVE NO SUCH SAFETY BACKUP IN A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION.

REPORTEDLY AT LEAST ONE ONE DEAD AFTER A TESLA MODEL S FOUND CRASHED IN A POND, IN CASTRO VALLEY CALIFORNIA, ALAMEDA COUNTY, 11567 CANYON ROAD. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL, ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF, ALAMEDA COUNTY FIRE AND PARAMEDICS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE CRASH. ONE MAN HAS BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE CRASH HAPPENED ON SUNDAY NIGHT. I SUSPECT EXCESSIVE SPEED, OVERCONFIDENCE, ARROGANCE AND POSSIBLE INTOXICATION MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CRASH AND DEATH. I SUSPECT THE TESLA CULTURE OF OVERHYPING SAFETY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CRASHES LIKE THESE. I SUGGEST THAT DATA FROM THIS AND OTHER EVENTS BE CHECKED AND INVESTIGATED. I SUGGEST THAT A UNIVERSAL STANDARD SHOULD BE MADE SO THAT GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATORS CAN CHECK WITHOUT THE RISK OF BIAS AND MANIPULATION BYTESLA AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS. I FEEL THAT TESLA AND THEIR CULT FOLLOWING FALSELY OVERSTATES THE SAFETY OF TESLA; THUS LEADING TO TESLA DRIVERS DRIVING RECKLESS, AGGRESSIVE AND ARROGANTLY. THE DRIVER IS OFTEN AT FAULT FOR THESE TYPES OF ACCIDENTS, HOWEVER THEY ARE OFTEN USED AS SCAPEGOATS. AS OFTEN THERE IS MORE FAULT THAN JUST THE DRIVER. THERE ARE OFTEN OTHER CONTRIBUTING AND/OR CAUSAL FACTORS. SUCH AS TESLA'S TENANCY TO SCAPEGOAT DRIVERS; RATHER THAN FIX UNDERLYING FAULTS/CONTRIBUTING FACTORS FROM TESLA DESIGN, NEGLECT, HYPE AND DENIAL. THE SWISS CHEESE MODEL OF SAFETY AND INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE FOLLOWED; RATHER THAN TESLA'S SCAPEGOAT METHODOLOGY. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH TESLA MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CRASH LIKE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, SUSPENSION AND STEERING PROBLEMS.

THIS A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE FATAL TESLA CRASH IN FORT LAUDERDALE. EVEN THOUGH THE NTSB IS INVESTIGATING THIS CRASH THE INQUIRY IS LIKELY TO TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR. I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS CRASH WAS CAUSED BY YET ANOTHER SUSPENSION FAILURE. HTTP://MIAMI.CBSLOCAL.COM/2018/05/10/NTSB-TO-INVESTIGATE-FIERY-CRASH-OF-TESLA-IN-FT-LAUDERDALE/ CRASH SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW THAT THE RH BACK WHEEL AND SUSPENSION HAVE FALLEN OFF THE CAR. THE ROAD IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHT AT THE CRASH SITE. THERE IS JUST A SINGLE SKID MARK WHERE THE CAR SUDDENLY WENT SIDEWAYS. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL DUE TO TAKING A CURVE TOO FAST. THE SKID MARK SHOWS A VERY SUDDEN SWERVE TO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD AND INTO THE WALL. THE VIDEO SHOWS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DETACHED WHEEL AND TIRE LYING IN THE ROADWAY. IT IS ALSO VERY CONCERNING THAT TESLAS BURST INTO FLAMES SO EASILY AND THAT THE ELECTRIC DOOR HANDLES BECOME INOPERATIVE PREVENTING OCCUPANTS OR RESCUERS FROM OPENING THEM. ONCE AGAIN THE EARLY STAGE OF THESE FIRES SEEMS TO BE FUELLED BY THE 7 GALLONS OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL. THE STORED ENERGY IN THE BATTERIES CAN EASILY BOIL OFF THE WATER CONTENT OF THE COOLANT CAUSING IT TO BECOME HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. THE FIRE DOES NOT YET APPEAR TO HAVE IGNITED THE ACTUAL BATTERIES SINCE THESE BURN WITH A WHITE HEAT AND THE INDIVIDUAL CELLS EXPLODE LIKE FIRECRACKERS. THIS SITUATION IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. PLEASE ACT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MORE LIVES ARE LOST.

REPORTEDLY: ON 5-8-18 ABOUT 7 PM IN FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA ALONG THE 1300 BLOCK OF SEABREEZE BOULEVARD; TWO TEENAGERS WERE TRAPPED AND BURNED TO DEATH AFTER CRASHING A TESLA MODEL S. A THIRD TEENAGER WAS EJECTED AND SERIOUSLY INJURED. IT WAS A SINGLE CAR ACCIDENT. EXCESSIVE SPEED IS THOUGHT TO BE A FACTOR. FRIENDS OF THE VICTIMS WERE FOLLOWING THE TESLA IN ANOTHER VEHICLE, AND SAID THE VEHICLE WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES PREVENTING WOULD BE RESCUERS FROM PULLING THE TRAPPED TEENAGERS FROM THE VEHICLE. ONLOOKERS WATCHED THEIR VICTIMS STRUGGLE AS THEY BURNED TO DEATH. THERE IS VIDEO OF THE TRAPPED VICTIMS BURNING TO DEATH. DID ALL THE AIRBAGS DEPLOY? WHY DID THE BATTERY CATCH FIRE AND POSSIBLY EXPLODE? WAS CRASH AVOIDANCE ACTIVE, IF SO DID IT FAIL? WERE ALL THE VICTIMS WEARING SEATBELTS? DID THE CAR HAVE SAFETY FEATURES TO DETECT PEOPLE NOT WEARING SEATBELTS AND WARNING SYSTEM?

HERE IS ANOTHER TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD: HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/38280127 IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY FIRE. DESPITE THE EXTREME FIRE DAMAGE IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE SUSPENSION LINKS ON THE RH BACK WHEEL ARE CLEANLY SNAPPED OFF. THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MELTED IN THE FIRE BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO CLEAR FRACTURES AND THE WHEEL HAS GONE WHOMPY. ANOTHER CASE OF FRAGILE ALLOY SUSPENSION PARTS CAUSING A CRASH FOLLOWED BY A FIRE MOST LIKELY TO TO LEAKING HOT GLYCOL FOLLOWED BY IGNITION OF THE BATTERY PACK. THESE CARS ARE WORSE THAN THE OLD PINTO AND CORVAIR. THEY ARE UNSAFE AT ANY VOLTAGE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. SEETHING CITIZEN ETC. ETC. DATE OF INCIDENT IS AN APPROXIMATION.

SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION TESLA. I DROVE MY TESLA FROM WORK, DRIVING OVER 35MILES DURING RUSH HOUR OF THE BAY AREA. WHEN I ENTERED MY SUBDIVISION, I WAS DRIVING AT 10 MPH, PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY MADE 90 DEGREES TURN AT 5 MPH, APPLIED THE BRAKES. INSTEAD OF STOPPING, CAR SPED UP AT EXTREMELY HIGH ACCELERATION. IT DROVE THROUGH THE GARAGE DOOR, HIT MASERATI PARKED IN THE GARAGE, AND A MOTORCYCLE PARKED NEXT TO IT. THE MASERATI TRUNK WAS PUSHED IN APPROX 3 FEET, IT SLID SIDEWAYS, HIT THE PILLAR, SMASHING DRIVER DOOR AND WINDOW, SLID TO THE FRONT AND HIT THE MOTORBIKE PARKED NEXT TO IT. IT COMPLETELY SMASHED THE REAR TRUCK, FRONT AND SIDE OF THE MASERATI. IT SMASHED THE FRONT END OF THE MOTORCYCLE. THERE WERE FLUIDS FRONT TESLA, MASERATI, AND BIKE ALL OVER THE GARAGE. THE BATTERY IN MASERATI EXPLODED LEAKING ACID ALL OVER THE GARAGE. WE THOUGHT THE FUEL TANK IN MASERATI BROKE. WE HAD TO CALL 911, DOZENS OF PERSONNEL SHOWED UP INCLUDING SEVERAL FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS, AMBULANCE, HAZMAT AMONG OTHERS. THEY SPEND OVER THREE HOURS CONTROLLING THE SITUATION. THEY HAD TO CUT THE GARAGE DOOR TO PULL OUT THE MASERATI AND TESLA. IT WAS TOWED TO A STORAGE FACILITY NEARBY. MASERATI WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS. I WAS COMPLETELY SHAKEN AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL FOR LAST THREE DAYS. WHAT IF MY KIDS HAD BEEN PLAYING IN THE DRIVEWAY OR IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THIS IS NOT A RANDOM INSTANCE. THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WHEREIN, WHEN A DRIVER MAKES A SHARP TURN INTO A DRIVEWAY OR GARAGE AND APPLIES THE BRAKE, RATHER THAN SLOWING DOWN CAR JUST DECIDES TO SPEED UP LIKE A BULLET AND GOES THROUGH THE WALLS OR WHATEVER COMES ITS WAY. I HAVE STOPPED DRIVING FOR FORESEEABLE FUTURE, I AM NOT GOING TO PUT MY STEP IN ANOTHER TESLA FOR MY SAFETY AND SAFETY OF OTHERS. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR/OTHERS

HERE IS A TESLA MODEL S IN THE JUNKYARD: HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/43880137/PHOTOS IT HAS BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE. ELON MUSK HAS CLAIMED THAT TESLAS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO CATCH FIRE THAN A GASOLINE POWERED CAR AND THAT THEY ARE NOW EVEN SAFER THAN BEFORE DUE TO THE TITANIUM BATTERY SHIELDS AND THE (TEMPORARILY) RAISED SUSPENSION HEIGHT. A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR BURNED TESLA OR TESLA FIRE REVEALS THAT THERE HAVE NOW BEEN AT LEAST 20 TESLAS DESTROYED BY FIRE WHICH IS A VERY LARGE NUMBER IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF CARS ON THE ROADS. I BELIEVE THAT THE 7 GALLONS OF HOT ETHYLENE GLYCOL IN EVERY TESLA IS A HIGH RISK FACTOR. IF THE LITHIUM BATTERY ALSO BECOMES INVOLVED IN A FIRE IT BURNS INTENSELY AND IS EXTREMELY HARD TO EXTINGUISH. NO OTHER ELECTRIC CAR HAS SUCH A HIGH RISK FACTOR OF HAVING ETHYLENE GLYCOL CARRIED IN RADIATORS AT THE VERY FRONT OF THE CAR PLUS SUCH A LARGE VOLUME OF FLAMMABLE LIQUID COOLANT. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. THANK YOU CONCERNED CITIZEN.

HERE IS A TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD: HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/46203307/PHOTOS IT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A FIRE. THE ALUMINIUM BODYWORK HAS BEEN MELTED AND BURNED AWAY. THE BATTERY PACK APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF THE FIRE. THE AIR-BAGS HAVE NOT BEEN DEPLOYED AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF COLLISION DAMAGE. THE INVESTIGATION INTO TESLA FIRES WAS CANCELLED AFTER TESLA FITTED A LIGHTWEIGHT TITANIUM BATTERY SHIELD AND RELEASED SOME VERY POOR QUALITY VIDEOS DEMONSTRATING THE INVINCIBILITY OF THE BATTERY SHIELD. THE RIDE HEIGHT WAS ALSO RAISED (FOR A FEW WEEKS) BUT SOON WENT BACK TO ULTRA-LOW. A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR "TESLA FIRE" SHOWS THAT MANY OF THESE CARS ARE STILL BURSTING INTO FLAMES. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM BEFORE MORE TESLA OCCUPANTS ARE INCINERATED. THANK YOU. CONCERNED CITIZEN.

HERE IS A TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD: HTTPS://WWW.COPART.COM/LOT/39926687/PHOTOS IT HAS BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE. THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION INTO TESLA FIRES BACK IN 2014 AND IT WAS CLAIMED THAT FIRES WERE CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRIS PUNCTURING THE BATTERY PACK AND THIS PROBLEM WAS SOLVED BY FITTING A BATTERY SHIELD. TESLAS ARE STILL CATCHING FIRE AT AN ALARMING RATE. I BELIEVE THAT THE CAUSE OF MANY OF THESE FIRES IS NOT THAT THE LITHIUM BATTERY CATCHES FIRE FIRST BUT THAT THE ETHYLENE GLYCOL LEAKS OUT AND CATCHES FIRE. THE ATTACHE PHOTOGRAPH OF A 2013 FIRE CLEARLY SHOWS THE COOLANT BLAZING BENEATH THE CAR. A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR "TESLA FIRE" SHOWS MANY OF THESE GLYCOL FIRES. THE LITHIUM BATTERIES MAY WELL IGNITE AS WELL BUT IN MOST CASES IT SEEMS THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF FIRE IS THE GLYCOL. ADVICE TO FIRST RESPONDERS SHOULD BE MODIFIED BECAUSE USING WATER IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO EXTINGUISH A FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. CONCERNED CITIZEN.

THIS IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF FIRES IN THE TESLA CARS. THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FIRES IN 2013. TESLA CLAIMED THAT THE FIRES WERE STARTED BY AN OBJECT PUNCTURING THE BATTERY PACK AND THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED BY THE ADDITION OF A BATTERY SHIELD. SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS MORE TESLA FIRES. IT IS OBVIOUS FROM LOOKING AT VIDEOS OF FIRES THAT IN MOST CASES IT IS NOT THE BATTERIES BURNING (THEY BURN WITH A WHITE FLAME AND WITH CELLS EXPLODING LIKE FIRE-CRACKERS) IN ALMOST EVERY CASE IT IS THE COOLANT FLUID THAT IS BURNING. PROPYLENE GLYCOL IS FLAMMABLE. EVEN WHEN DILUTED WITH WATER 50:50 IT IS STILL FLAMMABLE WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT HEAT TO BOIL OFF THE WATER CONTENT. WHEN THE BATTERY CELLS ARE HOT FROM RECENT CHARGING OR FROM HARD DRIVING THEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT THERMAL MASS TO BOIL OFF THE FLUID ESPECIALLY IF THE RADIATOR PRESSURE IS LOST. THE TESLA RADIATORS AND FLUID HOSES ARE AT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO IMPACT DAMAGE. TESLAS CONTAIN OVER 6 GALLONS OF FLAMMABLE GLYCOL. THE BATTERIES THEMSELVES WILL NOT SELF IGNITE UNLESS THEY ARE CRUSHED IN A HEAVY IMPACT. THE RISK OF FIRES FROM A LEAKAGE OF HOT PROPYLENE GLYCOL IS FAR GREATER. A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR TESLA FIRE SHOWS DOZENS OF CASES WHERE POOLS OF FLUID ARE BURNING ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE CAR AND THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. MOST OF THESE FIRES ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY BATTERY PYROTECHNICS THEY ARE SIMPLY COOLANT FIRES. PLEASE REOPEN THE FIRE INVESTIGATION.

THIS IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE FIRE DANGER IN TESLA VEHICLES. THE LATEST CRASH IN LAKE FOREST SHOWS THAT BURNING FLUID IS ESCAPING FROM BENEATH THE CAR AND IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTINGUISH. HTTP://WWW.NBCLOSANGELES.COM/NEWS/LOCAL/TESLA-LAKE-FOREST-HOME-FIRE-441816433.HTML THIS SAME FLUID THAT BURNS WITH A YELLOW FLAME CAN BE SEEN ANY MANY OTHER TESLA FIRES. PICTURES ARE ATTACHED. THE TESLA CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 8 GALLONS OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL MIX IN ITS BATTERY COOLANT SYSTEM. THIS CIRCULATES THROUGH RADIATORS AT THE FRONT OF THE CAR WHICH ARE EASILY RUPTURED IN A CRASH. IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT ETHYLENE GLYCOL IS FLAMMABLE ESPECIALLY IF IS PREHEATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES DUE TO SUPERCHARGING OR HARD DRIVING. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF FIRES AS HAPPEN WHEN THE LITHIUM BATTERIES THEMSELVES CATCH FIRE. THEY BURN WITH A WHITE FLAME AND EXPLODE LIKE FIRECRACKERS. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE TESLA COOLANT CATCHES FIRE VERY EASILY AND IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO EXTINGUISH. PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPHS FOR EXAMPLES OF THIS. THANK YOU. CONCERNED CITIZEN.

THIS IS A COMPLAINT INTENDED TO PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT TESLAS ARE EXPERIENCING SUSPENSION FAILURES AND ARE CATCHING FIRE AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN MOST OTHER VEHICLES.

HERE IS A REPORT OF A TESLA MODEL X CRASH IN CHINA. HTTPS://MP.WEIXIN.QQ.COM/S/1DIN0UYENLRL8BO9GYKPCG (GOOGLE WILL TRANSLATE) THE OWNER REPORTS THAT THE CAR SUDDENLY SLAMMED INTO THE CONCRETE CENTRE DIVIDER, SPUN 180 DEGREES AND COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER CAR. THE DRIVERS AIRBAG FAILED TO DEPLOY RESULTING IN VERY SERIOUS INJURIES: . THE REAR SEAT OCCUPANTS WERE UNABLE TO OPEN THE FALCON DOORS. THE EMERGENCY DOOR RELEASE IS NOT OBVIOUS TO OCCUPANTS AND REQUIRES THEM TO REACH UP BEHIND THE SPEAKER GRILL TO FIND THE PULL. THE CAR CAUGHT FIRE AND WAS BURNED TO ASHES. BYSTANDERS WERE UNABLE TO DOUSE THE FIRE USING REGULAR EXTINGUISHERS.. THE SUDDEN SWERVE, FAILURE OF AIR-BAG AND FAILURE OF DOOR RELEASE MECHANISMS IS CONSISTENT WITH FAILURE OF THE 12 VOLT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OR GROUND CONNECTION AS HAS BEEN REPORTED ON MANY OTHER OCCASIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS CAR IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. CONCERNED CITIZEN.

HERE IS ANOTHER BURNED OUT TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD. HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLE?ITEMID=24762753&ROWNUMBER=10&LOADRECENT=TRUE THE SUSPENSION HAS COLLAPSED ON THE LH SIDE AND THE FRONT WHEEL IS JAMMED INTO THE BATTERY. THE AIRBAGS HAVE NOT DEPLOYED. THE CAR DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN IN A COLLISION. THE WHEEL JAMMING INTO THE BATTERY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE FIRE. IF THE BATTERY IS HOT FROM HARD DRIVING OR FROM RECENT CHARGING THEN ANY LOSS OF COOLANT IS LIKELY TO CAUSE A FIRE. PLEASE CONDUCT A TEST TO SEE WHETHER SUCH A SIMPLE LOSS OF COOLANT CAN CAUSE A FIRE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE RATE OF FIRES IN TESLAS IS ALARMING AND IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO SUPPRESS A LITHIUM BATTERY FIRE. THANK YOU. CONCERNED CITIZEN ETC.

HERE IS A BURNED OUT TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLE?ITEMID=24822571&ROWNUMBER=3&LOADRECENT=TRUE THE FRONT LH WHEEL IS JAMMED BACK INTO THE BATTERY. THE TREAD ON THE TIRE IS WORN AWAY WHICH INDICATES THAT THE WHEEL WAS JAMMED BACK AGAINST THE BATTERY WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL ROLLING FORWARD. IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT SUSPENSION FAILURE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. DESPITE ASSURANCES TO THE CONTRARY FIRES ARE STILL HAPPENING ALL TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE TESLA. A RECENT CRASH IN CHINA RESULTED IN THE TESLA EXPLODING IN FLAMES AND THE BACK SEAT PASSENGERS ONLY NARROWLY ESCAPED INCINERATION.: HTTPS://ELECTREK.CO/2017/04/23/TESLA-MODEL-X-FIRE-CRASH-FALCON-WING-DOORS-STUCK/ I AM FILING THESE REPORTS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. OWNERS BELIEVE THE TESLA IS THE SAFEST CAR IN THE WORLD. JUDGING BY THE HUNDREDS OF TESLAS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SERIOUS ACCIDENTS THIS APPEARS TO BE A MYTH. PLEASE INVESTIGATE.

HERE IS A BURNED OUT TESLA IN THE JUNKYARD: HTTPS://WWW.SALVAGERESELLER.COM/CARS-FOR-SALE/22669817-2015-TESLA-MODEL-S-85-VALLEJO-CA I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INCIDENT BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW A BROKEN BALL JOINT IN THE FRONT LH SUSPENSION. THIS IS A STEEL COMPONENT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE POPPED APART DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE BUT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE ONE OF THE REGULAR CASES OF SUSPENSION FAILURE THAT AFFLICTS THE TESLA. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. CONCERNED CITIZEN ETC.
